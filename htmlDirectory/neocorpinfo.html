                <h1>Neocorps</h1>
                <p>The 4th corporate war ended the era of megacorp domination. While they still exist, they are not as strong as they once were.</p>

                <h2>New Corps Survive</h2>
                <p>While not as strong as they once were, many corporations still exist. Some are still running, but run like corporations normally did in the 1990s instead of the global militant corporations they once were. Other corporations broke down into smaller corporations, while other corporations were completely destroyed.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Still Dangerous</h2>
                <p>Due to the loss of power after the 4th corporate war, corporations are more power hungry than ever. Corporations may not be as strong as they once were, but plenty of corportations are still militant. They may not have legions of tanks and grand armies, but can still send out covert ops squads and play dirty.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Corporate Ladder</h2>
                <p>The concept of the corporate ladder is still present in cyberpunk. Managers bark orders at workers, executives bark orders at managers, presidents and CEOs bark orders at executives. The higher up the corporate ladder, the tougher the person is to reach, and the more reach they have.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Power shifts</h2>
                <p>After the end of the 4th corporate war, corporations are no longer running the world in place of governments. The US in particular went from being in several corporation's pockets to watching corporations' every move. Corporations now try their best to hide their shady dealings from government power. This is not as much an issue in Night City's Free State environment</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h2>Corner Office</h2>
                <p>Presidents of companies typically only answer to their board of directors or major stockholders. The corporate world is full of nepotism, deal making, brown nosing, cheating, and lying. Blackmail, extortion and frame-ups are common</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Teamwork is everything</h2>
                <p>Most executives that work for a corporation have a special "Team" that they hired for protection or power. These teams are full of weapons-specialises, computer technicians, and hired guns. They are usually cyber-enhanced with higher-end tech. They are typically seen in dead-zones looking for recruitment</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Golden Handcuffs</h2>
                <p>Most corporations offer contracts to people who join them to avoid people jumping from corporation to corporation. Breach of these contracts are severe, and can lead to a loss of a license, deminished wages, or worse. In extreme cases, corporations will send out an "extraction team", a highly armed group of Solos to get people to move from one corporation to another.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Rule of the Faces</h2>
                <p>This rule was put in place in the Free States, United States, European Theater China. In order to establish a corportation, you must assign a "Face" to a corporation that must take responsibility for corporate actions. This was set up after the 4th corporate war in order to make it so that CEOs and High Level Executives keep their company out of trouble, or at least, not tied to the company.</p>

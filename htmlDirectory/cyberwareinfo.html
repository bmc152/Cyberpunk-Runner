                <h1>Cyberware</h1>
                <p>Cyberware is hardware that is not removeable. It can be implanted in you or replace body parts. It's a major commitment, as you are replacing parts of you that you were born with. This does not make you a cyborg. If you have replaced enough parts of your body to be considered a cyborg by normal standards, you are considered someone always on the cutting edge of high tech living.</p>

                <h2>Style over function</h2>
                <p>The social norm is that people use cyberware for fashion and style. Getting a weapon upgrade for an arm is fine, but if you can't conceal it, you'll draw attention. For example, if you have a shoulder-mounted gun that you can't conceal, people will notice and get freaked out.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Cyber Lifestyle</h2>
                <p>It's considered "hip and aware" to have technology grafted onto you somewhere. Someone who is considered "Cybered up" probably have interface plugs to operate computers and vehicles mentally. People who work security and solos typically have combat chips, or a limb replaced to help in combat.</p>

                <h2>Cyberpsychosis</h2>
                <p>Cyberpsychosis is a dissociative disorder in which someone with "Psychopathic Tendencies" enhances themselves with cybernetics to the point where they no longer see themselves as sapient organisms, and more as a collection of replaceable parts. Players get this by continually upgrading themselves with cyberware with no regard or care, or by witnessing tragic events that widdlw down your humanity.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Practicing Safe Cyber</h2>
                <p>Cyberware that are used medically does not reduce humanity. However, medical cyberware only gives back functionality, and is not upgradeable without spending a fortune. Cyberware that changes appearance or changes your gender also don't reduce humanity. It's only when you replace a fully functional part of your body for the sake of upgrading does it reduce humanity</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Psycho Squad</h2>
                <p>Cyberpsychosis is a real problem in the dark future. That's why we have the psycho squad. The psycho squad is a police squad trained to capture or kill cyberpsychos. Most police departments have a psycho squad, and even in places of no government or law, locals typically make a makeshift psycho squad. They are heavily armored, armed, and have the best communications equipment and vehicles. They are typically not friendly people.</p>

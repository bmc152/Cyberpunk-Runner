                <h2>The Crash of 1994</h2>
                <p>After Euro-Combines created the World Stock Exchange, the US and the soviet union collapsed. This caused the two countries to go from economic superpowers, to a bunch of over-armed countries waving nukes around. Only one nuke has ever been used.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The 4th Corporate War</h2>
                <p>Before the 4th corporate war, everything was ran by corporations. They were basically governments. The war was fought between two of the world's largest Megacorps, Arasaka and Miltech. The war ended with a nuke being set off in Night City, causing the sky to go red.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>World Travel (What we miss)</h2>
                <p>You can travel the world with only one passport. World borders and governments are constantly changing. The global currency is the Eurodollar or "Eddy" for short.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Life on the street</h2>
                <p>16 People to an apartment, sharing food rations, thousands of apartments in a block thanks to megabuildings. This is normal street life. It's either live in these buildings with corpo-hired "cops", or roam the streets with boostergangs around every corner. Every apartment has TV, radio, and a sensory feed.</p>

                <h2>Closer than they thought (Early Cyberware History)</h2>
                <p>Prostetic cyberware that we knew was first developed in the 1980s. In the 1990s, they were beginning to be regularly used on animals and produce. In the 2000s, cybernetics became regularly used in the military, where a cybernetic boom was started to create better cyberware.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Technoshock</h2>
                <p>The technoshock was when cyberware and technology began appearing in the public on mass. Most people had their lives changed and waited for their leaders to tell them what to do next. Then there was the Neo-Luddite movement, in which a small group of people completely turned their back on technology. Finally, the remaining people decided to embrace technology, calling themselved Cyberpunks.</p>
